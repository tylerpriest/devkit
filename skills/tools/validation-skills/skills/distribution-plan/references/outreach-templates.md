# Outreach Templates

Ready-to-customize templates for direct outreach, community engagement, and follow-up. Every template MUST be personalized -- copy-pasting generic messages converts nobody and damages your reputation.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Every message must reference their specific situation.** Mention their post, their problem, their context.
2. **Keep it under 100 words.** Respect their time.
3. **Offer value first, product second.** Lead with help, not a pitch.
4. **Low-commitment ask.** Not "buy this" but "want to see how it works?"
5. **Follow up ONCE.** If no response after one follow-up, move on.
6. **Full disclosure.** If you built the product, say so. Transparency builds trust.

## Reddit DM Templates

### Template 1: Active Seeker Response

Use when someone has posted asking for a solution or recommendation.

```
Hey [username], saw your post in r/[subreddit] about [specific problem they described].

I dealt with the same thing -- spent [time period] doing [their manual process] before
I found a good solution. [1 sentence of genuine advice that helps regardless of your product].

I actually ended up building a tool that handles [their specific stated need]. Happy to
give you free access if you want to try it -- no strings attached. Genuinely curious if
it solves your version of the problem.

### Template 2: Competitor Frustration Response

Use when someone is complaining about a competitor you can replace.

```
Hey [username], saw your comment about [competitor] in r/[subreddit]. The [specific
complaint they mentioned] drove me crazy too -- that's actually why I built [product].

It specifically addresses [their complaint] by [how you solve it differently]. It doesn't
do [honest limitation] yet, but for [their use case], it might be worth a look.

Use when someone is discussing the problem but not explicitly seeking a solution.

```
Hey [username], your post about [problem] really resonated. I've been working on this
exact problem for [time period] and found that [useful insight or advice].

If you're open to it, I built a tool that approaches [problem] differently than most
solutions out there. Specifically, it [key differentiator]. No pressure at all --

## Community Engagement Scripts

### Script 1: Helpful Response (No Product Mention)

For your first 2 weeks in a community -- build credibility before mentioning products.

```
[Acknowledge their question/problem]
That's a common challenge with [topic]. Here's what I've found works:

1. [Specific, actionable tip]
2. [Another practical suggestion]
3. [Resource or approach they might not know about]

[Personal experience that adds credibility]
I ran into this when I was [relevant context]. The thing that made the biggest
difference was [key insight].

[Open invitation for follow-up]
Happy to elaborate on any of these if helpful.
```

### Script 2: Product Mention in Context

For when a thread is directly relevant to what you built, after you have established credibility.

```
[Helpful advice first -- at least 2-3 sentences of genuine value]

Full disclosure -- I actually built a tool for this exact use case. It
[what it does] specifically for [their audience/situation].

It's not perfect for everyone -- it works best when [ideal use case] and
doesn't do [honest limitation]. But for what you described, it might be
worth checking out: [link]

Either way, the advice above should help with the immediate problem.
```

### Script 3: Build-in-Public Update

For sharing your journey in relevant communities.

```
[Milestone or learning, not a product pitch]

Just hit [specific milestone] with [Product] -- [specific number] users
in [timeframe]. Here's what I learned:

- [Surprising insight about the problem/market]
- [What worked in customer acquisition]
- [What didn't work and why]

The biggest thing I didn't expect: [genuine learning].

Happy to answer questions about [the journey / the problem space / anything].
```

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up 1: After No Response to Initial Outreach (Send After 3-5 Days)

```
Hey [name], just bumping this in case it got buried. Totally understand if
it's not relevant right now -- just didn't want you to miss it if the
[problem] is still on your mind.

[Original link or offer]

No need to reply if it's not a fit.
```

### Follow-Up 2: After Trial Signup But No Usage (Send After 3 Days)

```
Subject: Quick check-in

Hi [Name], noticed you signed up for [Product] a few days ago but haven't
had a chance to try it yet. Totally normal -- everyone's busy.

If you have 5 minutes, here's the single fastest way to see if it helps:
[One specific action with a direct link to do it]

If you hit any issues or the product isn't what you expected, I'd genuinely
love to know. Just reply to this.

## Templates for Specific Channels

### LinkedIn Message (Keep Very Short)

```
Hi [Name], saw your post about [topic]. I built [Product] to solve
[specific problem] for [audience]. Would a 60-second demo video be
useful? No call needed.
```

### Twitter/X DM

```
Hey! Saw your tweet about [problem]. I built something for exactly this
-- [one sentence description]. Happy to share a quick demo if you're
interested. No pitch, just showing how it works.
```

### Hacker News Comment (Show HN or Relevant Thread)

```
[Substantive technical contribution first -- at least 2-3 sentences]

Related: I built [Product] which takes a different approach to this.
[Brief technical description of how]. Source: [link]

Curious to hear feedback from this community.
```

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Send)

### Generic Spray-and-Pray

```
NEVER: "Hey! Check out [Product] -- the best [category] tool for [vague audience].
Sign up today at [link]!"
```

This is spam. It will get you banned, ignored, and reported.

### The Hard Sell

```
NEVER: "I see you have [problem]. Our product solves this for just $29/mo!
Limited time offer. Sign up now before the price goes up!"
```

Urgency tactics and hard sells destroy trust, especially on Reddit.

### The Humble Brag

```
NEVER: "So I accidentally built a tool that now has 10,000 users and generates
$50K MRR. Anyway, here's the link if you're interested..."
```

This reads as self-promotion disguised as a story. Be genuine.
