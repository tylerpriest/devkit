# The Mom Test Method

Full methodology adapted from Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test" for product validation conversations.

## Why It's Called "The Mom Test"

Even your mom will lie to you about your startup idea. She loves you. She wants to be supportive. She'll say "that sounds great!" even if your idea is terrible. The Mom Test is a set of rules for crafting questions that even your mom can't lie about — because you're asking about her life and behavior, not about your idea.

## The Three Rules

### Rule 1: Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea

Never pitch. Never describe your product. Instead, ask about their existing workflows, frustrations, and behaviors. The moment you describe your idea, you've contaminated the conversation — they'll tell you what you want to hear.

**Bad:** "I'm building a tool that automates inventory tracking. Would you use it?"
**Good:** "Walk me through how you track inventory right now. What does that look like day to day?"

### Rule 2: Ask About Specifics in the Past, Not Hypotheticals About the Future

People are terrible at predicting their own future behavior. They're reasonably honest about what they've actually done in the past.

**Bad:** "Would you pay $29/month for this?"
**Good:** "What have you spent money on to solve this? How much?"

**Bad:** "How often would you use this?"
**Good:** "How often did this come up last month? Tell me about the last time."

### Rule 3: Talk Less, Listen More

If you're talking more than 30% of the time, you're pitching, not learning. Your job is to ask a question, then shut up. Let the silence work. People fill uncomfortable silences with truth.

## Questions That Work

### About the Problem

These questions reveal whether the problem is real and how painful it is:

- **"What's the hardest part about [doing this thing]?"** — Open-ended, reveals their framing of the pain.
- **"Tell me about the last time that happened."** — Forces specifics. Vague answers = vague problem.
- **"How are you dealing with it now?"** — Reveals workarounds and price anchors.
- **"What have you tried? What didn't work?"** — Shows whether they've actively sought solutions.
- **"How much time does it take you?"** — Quantifies the pain in hours.
- **"How much money does it cost you?"** — Quantifies the pain in dollars.
- **"What happens if you don't solve this?"** — Tests urgency. If the answer is "nothing much," the problem isn't severe.

### About Existing Behavior (Most Revealing)

Past behavior is the single best predictor of future behavior:

- **"Have you ever searched for a solution to this?"** — If no, the problem isn't painful enough to drive action.
- **"What did you find? Why didn't it work?"** — Reveals the competitive landscape and unmet needs.
- **"What are you paying for right now to solve this?"** — Establishes willingness to pay.
- **"When did you last look for something better?"** — Recency = urgency.
- **"Have you ever tried to build your own solution?"** — DIY = high pain, high motivation.

### About Urgency and Priority

These separate "would be nice" from "need this now":

- **"Where does this rank in your priorities right now?"** — If it's not top 3, they won't switch.
- **"Is there a budget for solving this?"** — Budget = real. No budget = theoretical interest.
- **"What happens if you never solve this?"** — Tests whether they can live with the status quo.
- **"What would you need to see to switch from what you use now?"** — Reveals switching triggers.
- **"Is there a deadline or event driving this?"** — Deadlines create urgency.

## Questions That Fail

Never ask these — they produce unreliable data:

- **"Would you use a product that does X?"** — Hypothetical. Everyone says yes. Worthless.
- **"How much would you pay for X?"** — People lowball in the abstract. Anchors to nothing.
- **"Do you think this is a good idea?"** — Fishing for compliments. You'll always get them.
- **"Would you recommend this to a friend?"** — Aspirational, not behavioral. Useless data.
- **"On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this?"** — Abstract scale, no actionable insight.

### The Deadly Fluff

"The world's most deadly fluff is: 'I would definitely buy that.' It just sounds so concrete. As a founder, you desperately want to believe it's money in the bank. But folks are wildly optimistic about what they would do in the future." — Rob Fitzpatrick

**How to deflect fluff:**
- "That's great to hear — when was the last time you actually looked for a solution?"
- "Sounds like this matters to you — what have you tried so far?"
- "If you were going to solve this this week, what's the first thing you'd do?"

## Commitment Currencies

Real interest is measured by what people GIVE UP, not what they SAY. After a good conversation, push for a commitment. The commitment they give (or refuse) tells you everything.

### Time Commitments (Moderate Signal)
- Agreeing to a follow-up meeting
- Participating in a trial or pilot
- Providing detailed, specific feedback on a prototype
- Introducing you to their team or decision-maker
- Spending 30+ minutes in a conversation (unprompted)

### Reputation Commitments (Strong Signal)
- Introducing you to their professional network
- Offering a public testimonial or case study
- Vouching for you within their organization
- Sharing your product with their audience

### Financial Commitments (Strongest Signal)
- Pre-ordering or making a deposit
- Putting a credit card on file (even for a free trial)
- Paying for a pilot program
- Signing a letter of intent
- Writing a check

**The commitment ladder (weakest to strongest):**

| Signal | Strength | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| "I'd definitely pay for that" | Worthless | People lie to be nice |
| "Cool idea!" | Worthless | Compliments are fool's gold |
| Email signup | Weak | 2-5% convert, mostly curiosity |
| Clicked a CTA / fake door | Moderate | Behavioral intent, but low cost |
| Joined waitlist with specific use case | Good | Effort + specificity |
| Booked a demo or call | Strong | Time commitment |
| Pre-paid deposit | Very strong | Money on the table |
| Credit card on file | Strongest | Real financial commitment |

## Zombie Leads Warning

Zombie leads are people who express interest but never convert. They accumulate when you fail to push for advancement.

**Classic zombie phrases:**
- "Let me know when it's ready" = not interested enough to engage now
- "Sounds great, keep me posted" = polite dismissal
- "I'll definitely check it out" + no follow-through = dead lead
- "Send me more info" + never responds = gone forever
- "Put me on the beta list" + never opens your emails = ghost

**Prevention:** Always end conversations with a concrete next step.
- Not "I'll keep you posted" but "Can I show you a demo Thursday at 2pm?"
- Not "Sign up for the waitlist" but "I'd like to share a prototype next week — what's the best email?"
- Not "Great talking to you" but "Would you be willing to test this for a week and give me feedback?"

If they decline the concrete next step, that IS your data. They're not interested enough. Move on.

## Running a Good Problem Interview

### Before the Interview
- Write down your 3 riskiest assumptions about the problem
- Prepare open-ended questions targeting those assumptions
- Decide what commitment you'll ask for at the end
- Set a goal: what specific thing would make you more or less confident?

### During the Interview
- Spend the first 2 minutes on context (their role, situation, day-to-day)
- Ask about the problem generally, then drill into specifics
- When they say something interesting, ask "Tell me more about that"
- When they give a vague answer, ask "Can you give me a specific example?"
- Take notes on exact phrases (their words, not your interpretation)
- Watch for emotional intensity — leaning forward, sighing, frustration in voice
- In the last 5 minutes, ask for a commitment

### After the Interview
- Write up key quotes within 1 hour (memory fades fast)
- Update your assumption tracker: confirmed, invalidated, or still uncertain
- Note: what surprised you? That's where learning happens.
- If 3+ interviews reveal the same pattern, you have signal.
- If 5 interviews reveal nothing consistent, the problem may not be sharp enough.

### Sample Size Guidelines
- 5 conversations: enough to spot strong patterns or kill obviously bad ideas
- 10 conversations: solid for validating problem existence and severity
- 20+ conversations: statistical confidence for segmentation and pricing signals
- 0 conversations: the most common number. Don't be this founder.

## Complainer vs Customer: The Definitive Test

**Ask this one question:** "What have you tried to solve this?"

- **"Nothing."** — They're a complainer. The problem isn't painful enough to drive action. Move on.
- **"I Googled it but didn't find anything good."** — Weak signal. They searched but didn't invest effort. Dig deeper.
- **"I've tried [specific tool] but it doesn't [specific thing]."** — Real customer. They've invested time, have specific needs, and know the landscape.
- **"I built my own [spreadsheet/script/workaround]."** — Best customer. They've invested significant effort. Your product needs to beat their DIY solution.
- **"I'm paying $X/month for [competitor] but I hate that it [specific complaint]."** — Golden customer. Budget exists, pain is real, switching trigger is identified.
