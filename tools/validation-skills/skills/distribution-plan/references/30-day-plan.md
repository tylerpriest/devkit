# 30-Day Plan: First 10 Paying Customers

## Daily Cadence (30-45 Minutes, Every Day)

This is the minimum daily commitment throughout all 4 weeks:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 15 min | Check monitoring tools for new active-seeker threads. Respond to relevant ones. |
| 10 min | Engage in target communities (help, don't sell). Answer questions, add value. |
| 10 min | Check analytics. Respond to any inbound interest IMMEDIATELY. |
| 5 min | One piece of build-in-public content (tweet, comment, or short update). |

**The consistency principle:** The indie founders who succeed are not the ones with the best launch. They are the ones who show up every day for 6-12 months. 30-45 minutes of daily distribution effort beats a single 8-hour push once a month.
