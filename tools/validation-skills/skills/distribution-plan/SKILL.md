# Distribution Plan

> Create a prioritized, day-by-day plan to acquire your first 10 paying customers through direct outreach, community embedding, and lightweight paid channels.

## Before Starting

Read `.claude/validation-context.md` to load the current product context. If it doesn't exist, run the `validation-context` skill first.

## Purpose

Distribution is not an afterthought -- it is a product feature. The #1 reason indie products fail is the 80/0 split: 80% time building, 0% time finding customers. This skill flips that ratio for the critical first-customer phase. It produces a specific, actionable 30-day plan with daily tasks, outreach templates, channel priorities, and success metrics -- all tailored to your product and audience.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Distribution Mindset Check

Before tactics, internalize two principles:

**Principle 1: "Do things that don't scale" (Paul Graham)**

Your first 10 customers should NOT come from scalable channels. They should come from personal outreach, manual onboarding, and high-touch interactions that teach you what works before you try to automate it.

**Principle 2: Every early customer is a distribution channel**

Treat your first 10 customers as partners, not transactions. Their word-of-mouth, their testimonials, their exact words about why they use your product -- these are worth more than any ad spend at this stage.

**The Geocodio lesson:** Hit #1 on Hacker News for a full day. Made $31 their first month. A launch is a spike, not a strategy. Sustainable distribution requires consistent daily effort after the launch high fades.

### Step 2: Identify Your Channels

Based on audience research from Phase 3 and smoke test results from Phase 6, prioritize channels:

**Tier 1: Highest Conversion (Start Here)**

1. **Direct outreach to active seekers**
   - Find people asking for solutions in forums RIGHT NOW
   - Personalized message referencing their specific problem
   - Offer free access or personal setup -- you are learning, not selling
   - Expected conversion: 10-30% when hyper-personalized

2. **Reddit organic engagement**
   - The highest-signal, lowest-cost channel for itch products
   - 57% of Reddit users research products before buying
   - Threads rank on Google for months/years (long-tail traffic bonus)
   - Low-comment threads (5-15 comments) convert better than viral posts
   - See `references/reddit-playbook.md` for detailed tactics

3. **The Collison Installation**
   - Named after Stripe founders who installed Stripe on users' laptops on the spot
   - When someone shows interest, do not say "check it out when you get a chance"
   - Say: "Give me your laptop, I'll set it up right now" (or the digital equivalent)
   - Personal onboarding for ANYONE who shows interest
   - First 10 users should feel signup was the best decision they made this week

**Tier 2: Medium Conversion (Add Week 2-3)**

4. **Community embedding (Arvid Kahl method)**
   - Join target communities and contribute value for 2+ weeks before any product mention
   - The community should know you as "the helpful person who knows about [domain]" BEFORE they know you as "the person with a product"
   - 70/30 rule: 70% genuine help, 30% product mention (only when relevant)

5. **Build-in-public storytelling**
   - Your origin story is a distribution asset: "I had this problem, couldn't find a solution, so I built one"
   - Platform: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Indie Hackers
   - Revenue/growth milestones consistently go viral
   - More useful for network building than direct customer acquisition

6. **Show-don't-tell demos**
   - 60-second Loom video showing your product solving the specific problem
   - More effective than any written pitch
   - Record personalized demos for each outreach prospect
   - No intro animation, no logo -- start with the problem, end with the solution

**Tier 3: Lower Conversion, Higher Scale (Add Week 3-4)**

7. **Google Ads on decision-stage keywords**
   - 5-10 high-intent keywords from Phase 2
   - $5-10/day budget (enough for 3-5 clicks at most CPCs)
   - Landing page: smoke test page from Phase 6
   - Run for 14+ days before optimizing

8. **Content/SEO seeds**
   - Not for first 10 customers, but plant seeds now
   - Write 2-3 articles targeting long-tail keywords from Phase 2
   - Answer questions your audience is actually asking
   - Compounds over months: articles that rank bring free traffic indefinitely

### Step 3: Build Your Prospect List

Compile a list of 50+ active seekers using these sources:

**Where to find prospects:**
1. Reddit threads with buying intent (from Phase 2/3 research)
2. Twitter/X: search for complaint keywords related to the problem
3. ProductHunt comments on competitor products
4. G2/Capterra reviewer profiles (especially 2-3 star reviews of competitors)
5. GitHub issues on related repositories
6. Industry Slack/Discord channels
7. LinkedIn: search for job titles matching your target audience

**What to capture for each prospect:**
- Name / username
- Platform where you found them
- Their specific problem or complaint (exact quote)
- Link to their post/comment
- Outreach status (not contacted / contacted / replied / converted)

### Step 4: Craft Your Outreach

See `references/outreach-templates.md` for ready-to-use templates.

**Core outreach principles:**
- NEVER copy-paste the same message. Each outreach MUST reference their specific situation.
- Keep it under 100 words. Respect their time.
- Offer free access or a personal demo, not a sales pitch. You are learning, not selling.
- Follow up ONCE if no response. Then stop.
- Lead with their pain, not your product.

**The hyper-specific outreach formula:**
1. **Reference**: Mention their specific situation ("Saw your post about [problem] in r/[subreddit]")
2. **Credibility**: Brief proof you understand ("I spent 2 years dealing with the same thing")
3. **Value**: What you can offer ("I built a tool that specifically handles [their stated problem]")
4. **Low-commitment ask**: Not "buy this" but "want to see a 60-second demo?"

### Step 5: Set Up Monitoring

Ongoing distribution requires monitoring for new active seekers:

**Manual monitoring (free, 30-45 min/day):**
- Check 5-10 target subreddits daily, sort by "new"
- Google Alerts for decision-stage phrases + `site:reddit.com`
- Weekly check of competitor review sites for new complaints

**Semi-automated monitoring ($19-49/mo):**
- Syften: Reddit keyword alerts ($19/mo)
- F5Bot: Free basic Reddit keyword notifications
- PainOnSocial: Reddit pain point monitoring
- Set up alerts for decision-stage trigger phrases

**Decision-stage trigger phrases to monitor:**
- "looking for a tool that..."
- "evaluating alternatives to [competitor]"
- "has anyone replaced [X]?"
- "switching from [X] because..."
- "recommendations for [task]?"
- "willing to pay for [solution]"
- "best [category] for [audience]"
- "[competitor name] alternative"
- "I need something that..."

### Step 6: Built-In Virality Audit

Audit your product for natural distribution mechanics:

- [ ] Collaborative features that require inviting others
- [ ] Public-facing output (reports, pages, dashboards others see)
- [ ] "Powered by [product]" watermark on free tier
- [ ] Sharing functionality that benefits the sharer
- [ ] Integration directory (piggyback on partner audiences -- the Slack model)
- [ ] Referral program with meaningful incentives
- [ ] Community/forum where users help each other

If none of these apply, distribution will be 100% manual effort. That is fine for early stage, but consider building distribution INTO the product as you approach 50+ customers.

### Step 7: What Kills Distribution (Avoid These)

**Anti-Pattern 1: Founder communities as customers**
r/SideProject, r/StartupIdeas, most of Indie Hackers -- these are full of builders, not customers. Save these for accountability and advice, not customer acquisition.

**Anti-Pattern 2: Spray and pray**
Posting the same generic message across 50 subreddits. Gets you banned, destroys reputation, converts nobody. Better: 5 hyper-relevant, personalized interactions per day.

**Anti-Pattern 3: Feature addiction**
"Just one more feature, then people will want it." This is procrastination disguised as product work. Ship what you have. Build what THEY ask for, not what you think they need.

**Anti-Pattern 4: Avoiding sales conversations**
Many technical founders avoid direct outreach because it feels like "selling." Reframe: you are helping someone who has a problem you have already solved. Not telling them about it is the disservice.

**Anti-Pattern 5: Launch event dependency**
"I'll launch on ProductHunt and that'll be my growth." A launch is a spike, not a strategy. Even #1 Product of the Day yields days of traffic, not months. What happens after day 3?

**Anti-Pattern 6: Over-optimizing before distributing**
Spending weeks on landing page design, logo, brand colors, feature polish -- while having zero users. Get something functional in front of real people. You can polish later.

## Tools

### Required
- Web search, web fetch (for finding active-seeker threads, community research)
