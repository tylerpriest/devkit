# Product-Market Fit Measurement

How to measure whether you have achieved product-market fit, including the Sean Ellis Test, supporting indicators, and ongoing measurement methodology. Use this after launch, not during pre-launch validation.

## The Sean Ellis Test

The single most widely used PMF measurement, developed by Sean Ellis (first marketer at Dropbox, Eventbrite, LogMeIn).

### The Question

Ask your users:

> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

**Response options:**
1. Very disappointed
2. Somewhat disappointed
3. Not disappointed

### The Threshold

- **>= 40% "Very disappointed" = Product-Market Fit achieved**
- **< 40% = PMF not yet achieved. Focus on the "very disappointed" segment.**

### How to Administer

**Who to survey:**
- Active users who have used the product at least 2-3 times
- Users who have experienced the core value proposition
- NOT churned users (they already answered by leaving)
- NOT brand new users (they have not experienced enough to judge)

**Sample size:**
- Minimum: 40-50 responses
- Ideal: 100+ responses
- Below 40 responses: results are directional, not conclusive

**Frequency:**
- Run quarterly after initial measurement
- Run after major product changes or audience shifts
- Track the "very disappointed" percentage over time as your PMF indicator

### How to Interpret Results

**>= 40% Very Disappointed: PMF Achieved**
- Shift focus from validation to growth
- Study the "very disappointed" segment: Who are they? What do they love? What would they pay?
- Double down on what these users value -- do not dilute for the "somewhat" crowd
- Begin scaling distribution channels
- Consider raising prices

**25-39% Very Disappointed: Getting Close**
- Interview the "very disappointed" users intensively:
  - What do they use the product for specifically?
  - What did they use before?
  - What would they switch to if your product disappeared?
  - What is the #1 thing they would improve?
- Find the common thread among "very disappointed" users
- Build more of what THEY want, not what the "somewhat" users want
- Consider narrowing your audience to focus on the segment that loves you

**< 25% Very Disappointed: PMF Not Found**
- The product in its current form is not indispensable to enough people
- Options:
  - Change the target audience (audience pivot)
  - Change the core value proposition (positioning pivot)
  - Change the product significantly (feature pivot)
  - Kill it (if multiple pivots have not improved the number)

### Common Mistakes with the Sean Ellis Test

1. **Surveying too early**: Users need meaningful exposure before they can answer. Wait until they have used the product 2-3+ times.

2. **Surveying churned users**: They already voted with their feet. Include only active users.

3. **Small sample size**: 15 responses is noise. Wait for 40-50 minimum.

4. **Including warm contacts**: Friends, family, and fellow founders who use your product out of support will skew results positively.

5. **Running it once and stopping**: PMF is not a binary checkpoint. It can be gained and lost. Measure quarterly.

6. **Focusing on the wrong segment**: When you are below 40%, the instinct is to make everyone happy. Instead, focus exclusively on making the "very disappointed" segment ecstatic.

## Supporting PMF Indicators

The Sean Ellis Test is the primary measure, but these supporting signals provide additional evidence:

### Retention Curve Shape

**PMF indicator:** Retention curve flattens (does not go to zero).

- Plot: % of users active in week N after signup
- **PMF**: Curve flattens at some percentage (10%, 20%, 40% -- the number matters less than the flattening)
- **No PMF**: Curve continues declining toward zero

A flattening retention curve means some users find the product indispensable and keep coming back. Even if only 15% of signups retain, those users represent your PMF segment.

### Organic Referrals

**PMF indicator:** Users recommend the product without being asked.

- Are users sharing it with colleagues unprompted?
- Do you see signups from the same company/team (expansion)?
- Are users doing "Collison Installation" for their peers?
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) > 50 is a strong signal

### Willingness to Pay

**PMF indicator:** Users pay and continue paying.

- Trial-to-paid conversion > 30%
- Monthly churn < 5%
- Users upgrade to higher tiers without prompting
- Customers say "this is worth more than what I pay"

### Usage Depth

**PMF indicator:** Users engage with the product regularly and deeply.

- DAU/MAU ratio > 25% (daily active / monthly active)
- Session frequency increasing over time
- Feature adoption broadening (users exploring more of the product)
- Power user emergence (users pushing the product to its limits)

### Inbound Interest

**PMF indicator:** People come to you without outreach.

- Organic search traffic growing
- Word-of-mouth mentions in communities
- Inbound demo requests
- Users finding you through long-tail searches

## PMF Measurement Framework

### Phase 1: Pre-PMF Measurement (0-50 Users)

At this stage, quantitative measurement is premature. Focus on qualitative signals:

- **User conversations**: Talk to every user. Ask what they use, why, and what they would change.
- **Usage observation**: Watch them use the product (screen share, session recordings). Where do they struggle? Where do they light up?
- **Retention check**: Are your first 5 users still using it after 30 days?
- **Referral behavior**: Has any user recommended it to someone else without being asked?

### Phase 2: Early PMF Signal (50-200 Users)

Start quantitative measurement:

- Run Sean Ellis Test (aim for 50+ responses)
- Track weekly retention cohorts
- Monitor organic signup sources
- Calculate trial-to-paid conversion rate

**Target**: 30%+ "very disappointed" at this stage. You are building toward 40%.

### Phase 3: PMF Validation (200+ Users)

Full measurement suite:

- Sean Ellis Test quarterly (100+ responses)
- Retention curve analysis (weekly cohorts, 8-week view)
- NPS survey (quarterly)
- Revenue metrics: MRR growth, churn rate, expansion revenue
- Acquisition metrics: organic vs paid, referral rate, CAC trends

**Target**: 40%+ "very disappointed." Retention curve flattening. Monthly churn < 5%.

### Phase 4: Post-PMF Growth

Once PMF is confirmed, measurement shifts from "do we have it?" to "are we keeping it?":

- Continue Sean Ellis Test quarterly (watch for regression)
- Monitor retention by segment (PMF can exist in one segment and not others)
- Track PMF as you move upmarket, add features, or change pricing
- Watch for PMF erosion from: competitor improvements, market changes, feature bloat

## When PMF Is Segment-Specific

A critical insight: PMF is almost always segment-specific before it is market-wide.

### How to Identify Your PMF Segment

When Sean Ellis score is below 40% overall:

1. **Segment responses by user characteristics**: Job title, company size, use case, acquisition channel
2. **Find the segment where "very disappointed" exceeds 40%**
3. **Profile that segment exhaustively**: What do they have in common? Why do they love it?
4. **Double down on that segment**: Build for them, market to them, ignore the rest temporarily

### The Narrowing Strategy

Counter-intuitively, NARROWING your audience often increases PMF faster than broadening it.

- Before: "Project management for teams" -> 25% very disappointed
- After: "Project management for remote marketing agencies with 5-15 people" -> 52% very disappointed

The product may not change at all. The targeting changes. When you speak directly to a specific segment's problems in their exact language, the "built for me" feeling creates PMF.

## Connecting PMF to Earlier Validation Phases

| Validation Phase | PMF Connection |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Problem Extraction (Phase 1) | Did you identify the right problem? PMF confirms which problem your users actually value solving. |
| Demand Discovery (Phase 2) | Did demand signals match reality? PMF tells you if the demand was real and your product captured it. |
| Audience (Phase 3) | Did you find the right audience? PMF by segment reveals who truly needs your product. |
| Positioning (Phase 4) | Did your message resonate? PMF influenced by positioning accuracy. |
| Pricing (Phase 5) | Is the price right? High PMF + low conversion might mean pricing is too high. High PMF + easy upgrades might mean pricing is too low. |
| Smoke Test (Phase 6) | Did the landing page convert? Smoke test conversion predicts PMF but does not guarantee it. |
| Distribution (Phase 7) | Can you reach your PMF segment? Distribution effectiveness correlates with how well you know your PMF audience. |
| Go/No-Go (Phase 8) | PMF is the ultimate validation of your go/no-go decision. |

## The Timeline Reality

For indie/bootstrapped founders:

- **Average time to ramen profitability**: 3 years (data from Indie Hackers surveys)
- **PMF rarely happens in month 1**: It typically takes 6-18 months of iteration
- **The "messy middle"**: Between launch excitement and sustainable traction is where most founders quit
- **Persistence signal**: The founders who succeed are not the ones with the best launch. They are the ones who show up every day for 6-12 months, iterating based on evidence.

Keep showing up. Measure regularly. Iterate based on what the "very disappointed" users tell you. PMF is found through systematic effort, not through a single brilliant insight.
