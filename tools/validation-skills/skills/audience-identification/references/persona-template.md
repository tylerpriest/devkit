# 7-Dimensional Persona Template

A structured, evidence-based persona framework that goes beyond demographics to capture the behavioral and contextual factors that actually drive purchasing decisions.

---

## Why 7 Dimensions

Most persona templates focus on demographics (age, title, company size) and call it done. Demographics don't predict purchasing behavior. What predicts it: how severe the problem is, what they've tried, what triggered their search, and what their decision-making context looks like.

This template captures 7 dimensions that map directly to sales and marketing strategy.

## The 7 Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Identity and Context

The basics, but go deeper than demographics.

```markdown
**Role/Title:** [Specific job title or role]
**Company type:** [Industry, size range, stage]
**Day-to-day reality:** [What their actual workday looks like — not the job description, the lived experience]
**How they think of themselves:** [Self-identity beyond title — "scrappy founder", "the ops person who keeps things running", "the detail-oriented one"]
**Decision-making power:** [Can they buy without approval? Need a committee? Who else is involved?]
```

**How to gather this:**
- Reddit post history and flair
- LinkedIn profile patterns for the role
- Job posting descriptions (reveal actual responsibilities vs title)
- Community bios and introductions

### Dimension 2: Problem Experience

How they experience the specific problem your product solves.

```markdown
**Problem description (in their words):** "[Exact phrases from community research]"
**Frequency:** [How often they encounter the problem — daily, weekly, monthly]
**Severity:** [How much it disrupts their work or life — annoying, painful, crisis-level]
**Cost of the problem:** [Quantified if possible — hours/week, $/month, errors/quarter]
**Emotional impact:** [Frustration, anxiety, embarrassment, helplessness — from community language]
**When it's worst:** [Specific situations or times when the problem peaks]
```

**How to gather this:**
- Community posts describing the problem (especially emotional ones)
- Support forum threads about the problem
- Review complaints about existing solutions
- Interview data from problem-extraction phase

### Dimension 3: Current Solution

What they're doing right now to handle the problem.

```markdown
**Primary workaround:** [The main thing they do — spreadsheet, manual process, competitor tool, nothing]
**Secondary tools:** [Other tools involved in their workflow around the problem]
**What they've tried and abandoned:** [Past solutions and why they didn't stick]
**What they like about current approach:** [Switching barriers — the things that work "well enough"]
**What they hate about current approach:** [Specific complaints — these become your messaging gold]
**Money spent on current solution:** [$/month or $/year, including time cost]
```

**How to gather this:**
- "How do you handle [X]?" threads on Reddit
- Competitor review sites (what they praise and complain about)
- Tool recommendation threads
- Interview data

### Dimension 4: Search and Discovery Behavior

How they find and evaluate new tools — this determines your distribution strategy.

```markdown
**Where they look for solutions:** [Google, Reddit, ask peers, conferences, newsletters, app stores]
**Search terms they use:** [From keyword research — actual phrases, not your assumed phrases]
**Who they trust for recommendations:** [Peers, specific influencers, review sites, nobody]
**How they evaluate:** [Free trial, demo, comparison articles, Reddit posts, ask their team]
**Decision timeline:** [Impulse buy, days, weeks, months]
**Risk tolerance:** [Early adopter who tries everything, or conservative "wait and see"]
```

**How to gather this:**
- Decision-stage language from community mining
- "What do you use for [X]?" thread responses
- Review site engagement patterns
- "How did you find [tool]?" questions in communities

### Dimension 5: Buying Context

The practical realities of how they make purchasing decisions.

```markdown
**Budget authority:** [Can approve themselves, need manager approval, need committee/CFO]
**Budget range:** [What they typically spend on tools in this category]
**Price sensitivity:** [Price-conscious, value-driven, or "just solve it"]
**Procurement process:** [Self-serve signup, sales-assisted, RFP required]
**Success metric:** [How they'd know the tool is working — time saved, errors reduced, revenue increased]
**Switching cost tolerance:** [How painful migration/change is — data migration, team training, workflow change]
```

**How to gather this:**
- Pricing page engagement patterns (freemium vs paid tier adoption)
- Community discussions about budgets and spending
- "Is it worth the price?" threads
- Review site pricing complaints or praise

### Dimension 6: Trigger Events

What makes someone go from "I have this problem" to "I need to solve this NOW."

```markdown
**Primary triggers:**
- [Trigger 1: specific event that forces action — e.g., "hired 3rd employee and spreadsheet broke"]
- [Trigger 2: specific event — e.g., "lost a client because of missed deadline"]
- [Trigger 3: specific event — e.g., "new regulation requires compliance tracking"]

**Timing patterns:**
- [When triggers are most likely — Q1 planning, new fiscal year, seasonal peaks]
- [How long from trigger to purchase — days, weeks, months]

**Urgency indicators:**
- [Language that signals urgency: "need this by...", "just lost...", "have to..."]
```

**How to gather this:**
- "I finally decided to..." posts in communities
- "What made you switch?" threads
- Seasonal search volume patterns from demand discovery
- Review site descriptions of why they chose the tool

### Dimension 7: Objections and Concerns

What stops them from buying even when they want to.

```markdown
**Top objections:**
1. [Objection 1 — e.g., "My team won't actually use a new tool"]
2. [Objection 2 — e.g., "I've been burned by tools that promise and don't deliver"]
3. [Objection 3 — e.g., "The switching cost is too high right now"]

**Trust barriers:**
- [What they need to believe before buying — social proof, free trial, guarantee, peer recommendation]

**Competitor lock-in:**
- [What keeps them on current solution — data, integrations, familiarity, contracts]

**Past negative experiences:**
- [Bad experiences with similar tools that shape their expectations]
```

**How to gather this:**
- "Why I cancelled [competitor]" threads
- Negative review themes on G2/Capterra
- "Is it worth switching from [X]?" discussions
- Interview objection patterns

## Building Personas: Minimum Evidence Bar

**Do not create personas from imagination.** Every field should be backed by evidence from community research, search data, review mining, or interviews.

**Minimum evidence for a credible persona:**
- 5+ community threads with people matching this profile
- Specific language extracted from real posts (not paraphrased)
- At least 2 confirmed workarounds they use
- At least 1 buying signal (pricing discussion, tool comparison, switching thread)
- Budget range validated by competitor pricing and community discussion

**If you can't meet the evidence bar:**
Mark the persona as "hypothetical" and note which dimensions need validation. A hypothetical persona is a research plan, not a marketing tool.

---

## Persona Anti-Patterns

**The aspirational persona:** Describing who you WANT your customer to be, not who they ARE. If your persona is a VP at a Fortune 500 company but your evidence comes from freelancers on Reddit, you have a mismatch.

**The demographic persona:** "35-year-old male, lives in suburbs, MBA" — none of this predicts purchasing behavior. Focus on problem severity, budget, and buying context instead.

**The too-broad persona:** "Business owners" describes millions of people with nothing in common. Keep narrowing until the persona describes a specific enough person that you could recognize them in a community.

**The franken-persona:** Combining traits from different segments into one impossible person. If your evidence comes from two distinct groups, create two personas, don't merge them.

**The static persona:** Treating personas as fixed documents. Update them as you learn — every interview, every community thread, every customer conversation should refine the picture.
