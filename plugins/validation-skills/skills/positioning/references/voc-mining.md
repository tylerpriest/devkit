# Voice of Customer (VOC) Mining

Full methodology for extracting customer language from reviews, communities, and forums — adapted from the Joanna Wiebe / Copyhackers approach.

## Core Principle

Don't write copy from your head. Steal it from customers' own words.

The best headlines come from customer complaints, not creative brainstorms. Your job is to find the exact language customers use to describe their pain, their desired outcome, and their emotional experience — then reflect it back to them in your copy. When they read it, they think "this person understands me" because you're literally using their words.

## Where to Mine

### Tier 1: Highest Quality Sources

These sources produce the most authentic, unfiltered customer language.

**Amazon reviews** — For books and products in your problem domain
- People writing detailed Amazon reviews are describing their real experience
- Book reviews often contain richer problem descriptions than product reviews
- Search for books about the problem your product solves
- Look for reviews with "I bought this because..." — reveals the trigger event

**Reddit threads** — For unfiltered community discussion
- Anonymous = honest. People say things on Reddit they'd never say in a survey
- Search for problem-specific threads, not product-specific ones
- Long comment threads have the richest language variety
- Emotional posts (frustration, celebration) contain the best copy material

**G2 / Capterra reviews** — For competitor product evaluation
- These are people who BOUGHT a solution — they're your target customer
- The "What do you dislike?" section is pure positioning gold
- Reviews mention specific workflows and use cases
- Filter for your target company size and industry when possible

### Tier 2: Good Secondary Sources

**Support forums** — For competitor products
- People describing problems in their own words while seeking help
- Bug reports and feature requests reveal unmet needs
- "How do I do X?" questions reveal workflow expectations

**YouTube comments** — On tutorials and reviews of competitors
- Comments on "how to" videos reveal what people find confusing
- Comments on review videos reveal what matters in buying decisions
- Often more casual and honest than written reviews

**App Store / Play Store reviews** — For mobile competitors
- Short, punchy language that works well for ad copy
- Star rating + comment gives severity calibration
- Update-triggered reviews reveal what changes matter

**Quora / forum answers** — For non-technical audiences
- Questions reveal problem framing in plain language
- Top answers reveal what advice resonates most
- Follow-up questions reveal what's still unclear

### Tier 3: Supplementary Sources

**Twitter/X threads** — For professional audiences
- Short-form complaints and praise
- Thread conversations for deeper context
- "Hot takes" reveal emotional reactions

**Facebook Groups** — For non-technical audiences
- Particularly rich for local business, trades, hobbyists
- Group conversations are longer and more detailed than public posts
- "Does anyone else deal with..." posts are gold

**Slack/Discord communities** — For technical audiences
- Real-time, conversational language
- Harder to search but very authentic
- Help channels reveal pain in the moment

## What to Extract

### "Before State" Language

How people describe life BEFORE any solution. This becomes your headline and above-fold copy.

**Patterns to capture:**
- "I was spending [X hours/dollars] every [time period] on [task]"
- "My [thing] was [negative state] and I kept [consequence]"
- "I had [messy situation] and nothing was [desired state]"

**Real examples:**
- "I was spending 4 hours every Friday on reports"
- "My inbox was a disaster and I kept missing deadlines"
- "I had spreadsheets everywhere and nothing was connected"

### "Dream State" Language

What they WISH existed. This becomes your value proposition.

**Patterns to capture:**
- "I just want [simple desired outcome]"
- "If only I could [specific capability]"
- "I need something that [key requirement] without [common complaint]"

**Real examples:**
- "I just want everything in one place"
- "If only I could see my whole pipeline at a glance"
- "I need something that just works without hours of setup"

### Emotional Phrases

Vivid, specific frustrations. Use verbatim in copy — they're more powerful than anything you'd write.

**Patterns to capture:**
- "I'm so tired of [specific thing]"
- "I hate that [specific experience]"
- "I wish I could just [simple action]"
- "It drives me crazy when [specific situation]"
- "The worst part is [specific consequence]"
- "I can't believe there's no [desired solution]"

### Category and Solution Language

How they name the type of solution they want. This feeds SEO and category positioning.

**Patterns to capture:**
- "I need a simple [their category name]"
- "Is there an easy way to [task]?"
- "Looking for a [their description of the tool type]"
- "Like [known product] but for [their context]"

### Objection Language

What makes them hesitate about buying or switching. This feeds your FAQ section and objection handling.

**Patterns to capture:**
- "The problem with most [tools/solutions] is..."
- "I've tried [X] before but..."
- "I don't trust [type of product] because..."
- "It's not worth switching because..."
- "I would use something like this if it..."

## The 4-Star Review Deep Dive

Focus your review mining energy on 4-star reviews. Here's the systematic approach:

### Step 1: Find Reviews
- Go to G2/Capterra/Amazon for each competitor
- Filter for 4-star reviews
- If filtering isn't available, scan 3-4 star reviews

### Step 2: Read 20+ Reviews Per Competitor
- Yes, actually read them. Skim doesn't work. The language is in the details.
- Copy/paste the most vivid phrases into a document

### Step 3: Look for Repeating Patterns

**The "Love but wish" pattern:**
> "I love [feature A] but wish it could [missing thing Y]"
- Feature A = table stakes you must match
- Missing thing Y = your differentiation opportunity

**The "Great for X but not Y" pattern:**
> "Great for [use case A] but not [use case B]"
- If your beachhead is use case B, this is your positioning angle
- "Built specifically for [use case B]" becomes your H1

**The "Would be perfect if" pattern:**
> "Would be perfect if [specific improvement]"
- If you can deliver that improvement, say so explicitly in your messaging

**The "Works but" pattern:**
> "Works but the [aspect] is [complaint]"
- Common aspects: UX, price, setup time, support, integrations
- If you solve the complaint, lead with that in competitive positioning

### Step 4: Build the Phrase Bank
Organize extracted phrases into a structured phrase bank:

```markdown
## VOC Phrase Bank

### Pain Phrases (Before State)
1. "[exact phrase]" — [source, competitor, context]
2. "[exact phrase]" — [source, competitor, context]

### Outcome Phrases (Dream State)

2. "[exact phrase]" — [source, competitor, context]

```

## VOC Quick Formula

For a fast VOC pass when time is limited:

**One search query:** `"tired of [your problem domain]" site:reddit.com`

This surfaces real people using emotional language about your problem. Their exact phrases are probably better headlines than anything you'd write from scratch.

**One competitor review scan:** Read 10 four-star reviews of your closest competitor on G2 or Capterra. Pull the "love X but wish Y" phrases.

**Total time:** 30-60 minutes for a usable phrase bank.

## Transforming VOC into Copy

### The Translation

| Generic Marketing Copy | VOC-Derived Copy |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| "Streamline your workflow" | "Stop spending 4 hours every Friday on reports" |
| "Powerful analytics" | "See what's working right now, not what worked last month" |
| "Easy to use" | "Set up in 5 minutes, not 5 weeks" |
| "All-in-one solution" | "Replace your 4-tab spreadsheet with one dashboard" |
| "Save time and money" | "Get your Fridays back. That's 200 hours a year." |

The VOC version is specific, quantified, and uses the customer's actual language. It will always outperform generic marketing speak.

### Copy Formula: PAS with VOC

**Problem** (use "Before State" phrases):
"Every Friday, you spend 4 hours copying numbers from Salesforce into spreadsheets."

**Agitate** (use "Emotional" phrases):
"That's 200 hours a year. Half a working month. Gone. And you still make mistakes that your CEO notices in the Monday meeting."

**Solution** (connect to "Dream State" phrases):
"[Product] pulls from Salesforce, formats everything, and sends the report automatically. You get Friday afternoons back. Your CEO gets accurate numbers."

### Copy Formula: BAB with VOC

**Before** (use "Before State" language):
"You're managing 3 clients in spreadsheets. Deadlines slip. Files get lost. You spend your evenings on admin instead of actual work."

**After** (use "Dream State" language):
"Every project tracked in one place. Deadlines visible at a glance. Your clients see a professional operation. You leave at 5."

**Bridge** (your product):
"[Product] is the bridge. Set it up in 10 minutes and never go back to the spreadsheet."
