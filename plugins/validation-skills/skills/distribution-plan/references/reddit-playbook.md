# Reddit Distribution Playbook

The complete tactical guide for using Reddit as your primary distribution channel for itch products. Reddit is the highest-signal, lowest-cost acquisition channel for indie products -- here is exactly how to use it without getting banned.

## Why Reddit First

- Communities organized by PROBLEM, not industry -- you find people who have the exact pain you solve
- Users are brutally honest (better feedback than polite friends)
- Threads rank on Google for months/years (every helpful reply is long-tail SEO)
- 57% of Reddit users research products before buying
- Low-comment threads (5-15 comments) have the highest conversion rate
- Reddit organic traffic converts 6-10x better than cold paid traffic
- Cost: $0 plus your time

## The 70/30 Rule

70% genuine help with no product mention. 30% product mention, only when directly relevant.

### What 70% Looks Like

- Answer questions in your domain thoroughly without mentioning your product
- Share specific, actionable advice based on your expertise
- Link to genuinely useful resources (articles, tools, guides -- not just yours)
- Engage with follow-up questions
- Build karma and reputation in target communities for 2+ weeks before ANY product mention

**Example of good 70% contribution:**

> Someone asks: "How do you handle inventory for a small retail store?"
>
> Your reply: "I ran a small store for 3 years. Here's what worked: [detailed advice about inventory management best practices, specific techniques, common mistakes]. Most people use spreadsheets which works up to about 50 SKUs, then you need something more structured. [Link to a useful free guide, not your product]."

### What 30% Looks Like

- "I actually built something for this exact problem: [link]"
- Only when directly relevant to someone's specific question
- Acknowledge limitations: "It doesn't do X yet, but it handles Y well"
- Offer to help them personally, not just pitch the tool
- Always disclose: "Full disclosure, I'm the builder"

**Example of good 30% mention:**

> Someone asks: "Evaluating alternatives to [Competitor] for [your exact use case]"
>
> Your reply: "I used [Competitor] for a year and had the same frustrations -- especially [specific complaint they mentioned]. I ended up building [Product] specifically because [reason]. It handles [their specific need] but doesn't do [limitation] yet. Happy to give you a free trial if you want to try it. Full disclosure, I built it."

## Finding High-Intent Threads

### Decision-Stage Trigger Phrases

Search for these across your target subreddits:

**Active seeking:**
- "looking for a tool that..."
- "recommendations for [task]?"
- "best [category] for [audience]"
- "I need something that..."

**Competitive switching:**
- "evaluating alternatives to [competitor]"
- "has anyone replaced [X]?"
- "switching from [X] because..."
- "[competitor name] alternative"

**Budget intent:**
- "willing to pay for [solution]"
- "worth paying for"
- "free vs paid [category]"

### Where to Search

**Manual search (free):**
- Reddit's native search (limited but functional)
- Google: `site:reddit.com "[trigger phrase]"` -- more powerful than Reddit search
- Google: `site:reddit.com "[subreddit name]" "[problem keyword]"`
- Sort results by date to find recent threads

**Automated monitoring:**

| Tool | Price | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Google Alerts | Free | Email alerts for trigger phrases + `site:reddit.com` |
| F5Bot | Free | Basic Reddit keyword notifications via email |
| Syften | $19/mo | Reddit keyword alerts across multiple subreddits |
| PainOnSocial | Varies | Reddit pain point monitoring, GummySearch replacement |
| ReplyHub | $29/mo | AI-assisted Reddit reply suggestions |

### Thread Selection Criteria

**Sweet spot threads:**
- 5-15 comments: Enough engagement to be relevant, not so many that your reply gets buried
- Posted within last 7 days: Still active, people checking for new replies
- OP is asking a genuine question (not venting, not a rhetorical question)
- Subreddit allows tool recommendations (ALWAYS check subreddit rules)

**Avoid:**
- Threads with 100+ comments (your reply will never be seen)
- Locked or archived threads
- Subreddits that explicitly ban self-promotion
- Threads from months ago (unless they still get Google traffic)

## Reply Structure

Follow this exact structure for product-mention replies:

### Step 1: Validate Their Pain
Show you understand and have experienced it yourself.

> "Yeah, this is a real problem. I dealt with the same thing when I was [relevant context]."

### Step 2: Offer Genuine Advice
Share useful information regardless of your product. This builds credibility.

> "Here's what worked for me / here are the options I evaluated: [genuine advice, including non-product approaches]."

### Step 3: Soft Product Mention (Only If Relevant)
After providing real value, mention your product casually.

> "I actually ended up building a tool for this: [link]. Happy to answer questions or give you a free trial."

### Step 4: Be Available
Respond to follow-up questions quickly and helpfully. This is where trust is built.

### Step 5: Handle Objections Gracefully
If someone pushes back, respond honestly. Do not get defensive.

> "Fair point -- it doesn't handle [limitation] yet. For that use case, [alternative] might be better. I'm working on adding [feature] though."

## Subreddit Research

### How to Find Your Subreddits

1. **Start with the problem**: Search Reddit for your problem keywords. Note which subreddits threads appear in.
2. **Check subreddit sidebars**: Related subreddits are often listed. Follow the chain.
3. **Look at competitor mentions**: Search `site:reddit.com "[competitor name]"` and note the subreddits.
4. **Check subreddit size**: 10K-500K subscribers is the sweet spot. Smaller = too niche, larger = too noisy.

### Subreddit Evaluation Checklist

For each potential subreddit, check:
- [ ] Subscriber count (10K-500K sweet spot)
- [ ] Post frequency (at least 5-10 posts/day = active)
- [ ] Rules about self-promotion (read sidebar carefully)
- [ ] Types of posts that get engagement (questions? discussions? tools?)
- [ ] Moderator activity (active mods = healthy community but also enforce rules)
- [ ] Presence of your target audience (not just adjacent interest)

### Building Credibility in Subreddits

**Week 1-2 (No product mentions):**
- Subscribe and lurk. Read the top posts, understand the culture, inside jokes, and norms.
- Start upvoting and commenting on others' posts with helpful replies.
- Answer 3-5 questions per week in your domain of expertise.
- Build karma organically.

**Week 3+ (Earned product mentions):**
- You now have a post/comment history in the community.
- When a relevant thread appears, your reply carries weight because you have a reputation.
- Product mentions feel natural because the community already knows you.

## Reddit Ads (Supplementary)

Only use Reddit Ads AFTER organic validation. Reddit users are extremely ad-resistant.

**Setup:**
- Target specific subreddits identified in your research
- Budget: $50-100 for initial test
- Creative MUST use community language, not marketing speak
- CTA should be soft: "Check it out" not "Buy now"

**Expected performance:**
- Reddit click-to-signup: ~20% when targeting is good
- CPC: $0.50-3.00 depending on targeting and competition
- Best for: supplementing organic reach, not replacing it

**Creative that works on Reddit:**
- Text-based ads that look like posts (not flashy graphics)
- Problem-first messaging ("Tired of [problem]?")
- Honest, direct language (Reddit users smell BS instantly)
- Include limitations: "It's not for everyone, but if you [use case]..."

**Creative that fails on Reddit:**
- Anything that looks like a Facebook ad
- Corporate marketing language
- Urgency tactics ("Limited time!", "Act now!")
- Overpromising ("10x your productivity!")

## Common Reddit Mistakes

1. **Posting the same message in multiple subreddits**: Gets flagged as spam, may get you shadowbanned
2. **Leading with the product instead of help**: Triggers the community's BS detector immediately
3. **Ignoring subreddit rules**: Many subreddits have specific self-promotion policies. Read them.
4. **Using a brand-new account**: Reddit users check post history. A new account mentioning a product = instant distrust.
5. **Being defensive about criticism**: Reddit is harsh. Accept feedback gracefully. "That's fair, I'll work on that" wins respect.
6. **Treating Reddit like a marketing channel**: Reddit is a community. Contribute like a community member, not a marketer.
