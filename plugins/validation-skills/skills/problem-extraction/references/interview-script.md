# Branching Interview Script Template

A structured script for customer discovery conversations that adapts based on responses. Use this as a starting template — customize the specifics for your product domain.

---

## Pre-Interview Setup

**Goal for this interview:** [Write your specific learning goal before starting]
**Riskiest assumption being tested:** [What you'll believe less if this interview goes poorly]
**Commitment ask planned:** [What you'll request at the end — demo, intro, trial, deposit]

---

## Opening (2 minutes)

Start with context, not your product.

> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm researching how [role/people like you] handle [problem domain]. I'm not selling anything today — I just want to understand your experience. There are no wrong answers, and the more honest you are, the more helpful this is."

**Establish their context:**
> "To start, can you tell me a bit about your role? What does a typical day/week look like for you when it comes to [problem domain]?"

*Note their title, company size, and daily context. This frames everything that follows.*

---

## Problem Discovery (10-15 minutes)

### Opening Question

> "What's the hardest part about [doing the thing your product relates to]?"

**If they identify a clear problem → Branch A (Problem Exists)**
**If they say "it's fine" or can't identify pain → Branch B (No Obvious Pain)**

---

### Branch A: Problem Exists

They've identified a pain point. Now drill into specifics.

**Frequency and recency:**
> "How often does this come up? Tell me about the last time it happened."

*Listen for: specific timing, emotional language, concrete details. Vague = weak signal.*

**Impact:**
> "When that happens, what does it cost you? In time, money, or just frustration?"

*Listen for: quantified costs ("I spend 3 hours every Friday"), emotional intensity ("it drives me insane"), or business impact ("we've lost clients because of this").*

**Current workaround:**
> "How are you handling it right now?"

**If they have a workaround → Branch A1 (Active Solver)**
**If they have no workaround → Branch A2 (Passive Sufferer)**

---

### Branch A1: Active Solver (Best Prospect)

They have a workaround — they've invested effort in solving this. These are your best early adopters.

> "Walk me through your current solution. What does that workflow look like?"

*Document their exact process. This is what you need to beat.*

> "What do you hate most about doing it that way?"

*Listen for: specific complaints, not vague dissatisfaction.*

> "How much time/money does your current approach cost you?"

*This is your price anchor. Your product should cost less than their workaround.*

> "Have you looked for something better? What did you find?"

*Listen for: competitor names, feature gaps, reasons they didn't switch.*

**If they've evaluated competitors → ask:** "What stopped you from switching to [competitor]?"
*This reveals the objections your product must overcome.*

**If they built their own solution → ask:** "What made you decide to build it yourself rather than buy something?"
*This reveals either market gaps or extreme pain.*

**Push for commitment:**
> "I'm working on something in this space. Would you be open to seeing a prototype and giving me honest feedback? I mean genuinely honest — if it's bad, I need to know."

---

### Branch A2: Passive Sufferer (Weak Prospect)

They have the problem but haven't tried to solve it. This is a yellow flag — the problem may not be painful enough to drive purchasing behavior.

> "It sounds like this is frustrating. Have you ever looked for a solution?"

**If no:**
> "What's stopped you from trying to fix this?"

*Listen for: "not painful enough" (kill signal), "haven't had time" (mild interest), "didn't think anything existed" (awareness gap — potential opportunity), "too expensive" (price sensitivity data).*

> "If you could snap your fingers and fix this, what would the ideal solution look like?"

*This is speculative, so weight it lightly. But it reveals their mental model of a solution.*

**If yes but didn't act:**
> "What did you find? Why didn't you go with it?"

*Listen for: "too expensive" (price anchor), "too complicated" (simplicity opportunity), "didn't quite fit my use case" (niche opportunity), "I forgot about it" (not painful enough).*

**Gentle commitment test:**
> "If something existed that solved this in [simple way], would you want me to tell you about it?"

*A "yes" here is weak signal — just politeness. A "yes, and here's my email" is slightly stronger. A "probably not" is honest and useful data.*

---

### Branch B: No Obvious Pain

They don't identify the problem you expected. This is critical data — don't try to convince them they have the problem.

> "Interesting. So [problem domain] isn't a major challenge for you. What IS the biggest headache in your [role/workflow] right now?"

*They may reveal an adjacent problem you hadn't considered. This is how pivots are born.*

> "When you think about [broader area], what takes up the most time that you wish you could eliminate?"

*Listen for: unexpected pain points that might map to your capabilities.*

**If they reveal a different problem:**
Document it. If 3+ interviews surface the same alternative problem, you may have found a better positioning angle.

**If they truly have no pain:**
Thank them and end early. Not everyone is your customer. This is useful negative data.

> "Really appreciate your honesty. That tells me a lot. Before we wrap up — do you know anyone in your role who DOES struggle with [problem domain]? I'd love to talk to them."

*Referrals from non-customers often lead to actual customers.*

---

## Commitment Close (3-5 minutes)

Every conversation must end with an ask. The response IS your data.

### Commitment Ladder (choose appropriate level)

**Level 1 — Information commitment (weakest):**
> "Could I follow up in two weeks with a quick update on what I'm building?"

**Level 2 — Time commitment:**
> "Would you be open to a 15-minute demo next week when I have something to show?"

**Level 3 — Introduction commitment:**
> "Is there someone on your team / in your network who also deals with this? Would you be comfortable connecting us?"

**Level 4 — Trial commitment:**
> "I'm putting together a pilot group of 5 people to test this. Would you want to be one of them?"

**Level 5 — Financial commitment (strongest):**
> "I'm offering early access at [discounted price] for the first 10 people. Would you want to lock that in?"

### Reading the Response

| Response | What It Means | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Enthusiastic yes + suggests time | Real interest | Schedule immediately, follow up within 24hrs |
| "Sure, send me something" | Polite, but not committed | Send within 24hrs, expect 50% ghost rate |
| Vague positive ("sounds cool") | Not interested enough to commit | Note as weak signal, don't chase |
| "I'm not the right person, but..." + referral | Genuine help | Follow the referral immediately |
| Polite decline | Not your customer | Thank them, document the data, move on |
| "What would it cost?" | Buying signal | Share pricing, push toward trial/deposit |

## Pattern Recognition After 5+ Interviews

After 5 conversations, look for:

**Strong patterns (3+ people saying similar things):**
- Same problem described → validated pain
- Same workaround used → market gap confirmed
- Same competitor complaints → positioning opportunity
- Same language/phrases → copy gold

**Divergent patterns (everyone says something different):**
- Different problems → your problem statement is too broad
- Different audiences → you haven't found your beachhead
- Different objections → your positioning is unclear

**Silence patterns (things nobody mentions):**
- If nobody mentions your core feature → they don't need it
- If nobody mentions the problem unprompted → it may not be top-of-mind
- If nobody has tried to solve it → it's not painful enough to drive action

Update your problem statement and validation context after every 5 interviews.
